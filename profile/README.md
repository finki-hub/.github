# FINKI Hub

Welcome! This organization hosts a collection of open-source projects focused on **web scraping and providing accessible data related to the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI / FCSE) in Skopje**.

Our goal is to make publicly available information from the faculty easier to access and utilize for students, developers, and anyone interested in FINKI's activities, schedules, resources, or other relevant data points.

## Core Projects

Here are some of our key repositories:

- **[finki-scraper](https://github.com/finki-hub/finki-scraper)**: The core scraping engine, designed with modularity and extensibility in mind to collect data from various sources.
- **[finki-discord-bot](https://github.com/finki-hub/finki-discord-bot)**: A Discord bot that provides easy access to the data gathered by our scrapers directly within Discord.
- **[finki-chat-bot](https://github.com/finki-hub/finki-chat-bot)**: A RAG-based chatbot trained to answer questions related to the faculty using the scraped information.

These projects are often interconnected â€“ the scrapers gather the data, which is then utilized by bots or other services. Please refer to the individual repository READMEs for specific setup and usage instructions.

Explore our **[Repositories tab](https://github.com/orgs/finki-hub/repositories)** to discover all our projects!
